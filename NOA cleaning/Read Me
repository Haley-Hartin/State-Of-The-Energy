Python scripts for cleaning and organizing the NOAA datasets

NOAA Cleaning - Drops data before the year 1960

NOAA Cleaning 2 - Drops the datasets no in the USA and summarizes the monthly data into yearly averages.

NOAA Cleaning 2.5 - Creates a list to relate station to state and catch unidentified stations in another list. Creates Order.csv and MISC.csv

NOAA Cleaning 3 - Actually organizes the datasets from the stations into their respective state from the list created in Cleaning 2.5.

NOAA Cleaning Aggragate - Summarizes the data from all stations in a state.

NOAA Cleaning Final - Combines all the dataset for each state into one CSV file. Also adds in multileveled indeices and columns to make it easier to callout an attribute to examine and/or a specific year for one or more states.
